## MentorIA

This project was developed almost entirely using Gemini to build the code. It's made with React, Python, and MongoDB as the database. The queries are made through a Gemini API.

# Note: 
This project did not aim to create a program in the software architecture model, for example, following the MVC model in the backend. The objective is just to build a simple program created by Gemini using prompt 
engineering.
